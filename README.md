# modulare
I designed this repo while doing a week of cryptography in a class to automate some of the basic cryptographic methods we learned. I was then told a python module existed that already did this stuff lmao. Right now this entirely works through the command line, but the runner script is just an example, and if someone wanted to use this instead of the module, the 'ciphers.py' file is the main file; with 'main.py' acting as the runner. Includes all the input validation needed to ensure that the methods will work as intended, as far as I know. If you break something, tell me how!
If you saw this on replit, no you didn't ;) 
For real tho, I did right this on replit.com first, no this isn't plagarism.... cuz I wrote it there lmao
